                    She closed her eyes and then opened them again. What she was seeing just didn't make sense. She
                    shook her head seeing if that would help. It didn't. Although it seemed beyond reality, there was no
                    denying she was witnessing a large formation of alien spaceships filling the sky.
                    I love the feel of wood curls flying off the lathe as I begin to shape the log in front of me. The
                    sound of scraping changes based on the wetness of the wood, the speed at which the lathe is turning,
                    and the type of cut I am making. The smell and feel of wet wood being turned are unique. The water
                    is sprayed out as I cut through the different layers of wood. A log can turn into anything one's
                    imagination can think of with the right set of hands-on tools. I have those hands and imagination. I
                    use all of my senses and intuition to create a beautiful object. That is why I enjoy turning wood.
                    The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was there was
                    someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years or more
                    he imagined. Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now.
