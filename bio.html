                        She had been an angel for coming up on 10 years and in all that time nobody had told her this was possible. The fact
                        that it could ever happen never even entered her mind. Yet there she stood, with the undeniable evidence sitting on
                        the ground before her. Angels could lose their wings.
                        Twenty-five stars were neatly placed on the piece of paper. There was room for five more stars but they would be
                        difficult ones to earn. It had taken years to earn the first twenty-five, and they were considered the "easy" ones.
                        No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened. It didn't even really
                        make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, nothing in
                        his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly become a statue and although he could see what was
                        taking place, he couldn't move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even though it was the
                        truth.
